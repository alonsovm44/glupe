## The Glupe Guarantee

Glupe will ALWAYS be:
1. 100% free (no "pro" tier, no "enterprise" upsell)
2. 100% local-first (no cloud dependency)
3. 100% open source (MIT License, auditable, forkeable)

This is not a business strategy. It's a promise.

If I ever break this promise, the community has 
permission to fork and continue without me.
