# Yori Compiler

The **Yori Compiler** is a meta-compilation tool designed to bridge the gap between high-level human intent and machine execution. Its mission is to make programming accessible to everyone by allowing software to be built using natural language blueprints.

---

## 🚀 The Vision
Programming has traditionally required years of study to master syntax and memory management. **Yori** changes this paradigm by turning the developer into an **Architect**. You provide the "What," and the Yori Engine—powered by local and cloud-based AI—determines the "How," generating, verifying, and self-correcting code in **over 20 programming languages** until it produces a working result.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Universal Polyglot Support**: Generate and validate code in 20+ languages including **C++, Python, Rust, Go, TypeScript, Zig, Java, C#, and Bash**.
* **Natural Language to Code**: Compile `.yori` files containing descriptive logic directly into source code or executables.
* **Self-Healing Toolchain**:
    * **Compiled Languages** (C++, Go, Rust): Yori captures compiler errors and "evolves" the source code until it compiles.
    * **Interpreted Languages** (Python, JS, Ruby): Yori validates syntax and static typing before saving the file.
* **Hybrid AI Core**:
    * **Cloud Mode**: Uses Google Gemini (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash`) for high-speed generation.
    * **Local Mode**: Uses Ollama (e.g., `qwen2.5-coder`) for private, offline development.
* **Interactive Mode**: If the output format is ambiguous (e.g., just `-o app`), Yori launches an interactive menu to let you select the target language.
* **Modular Architecture (`IMPORT:`)**: Build complex software by splitting logic into multiple `.yori` files.
* **Zero-Dependency Design**: The compiler uses system-level tools (like `curl`, `g++`, `node`) already present on your machine.

## 🛠️ Technical Setup

### Prerequisites
1.  **Yori Core**: The `yori.exe` executable.
2.  **Ollama (Optional)**: Required for Local Mode (`ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:3b`).
3.  **Language Toolchains**: Yori uses the tools you already have.
    * For C++: `g++`
    * For Python: `python`
    * For Node: `node`
    * For Rust: `rustc`
    * *(If a tool is missing, Yori will warn you and offer to generate code in "Blind Mode".)*

### Configuration (`config.json`)

 Usage
 Command Syntax
 PowerShell> yori <file.yori> [-o output_name] [LANGUAGE_FLAG] [-u] [-local | -cloud]
Language Flags (The Polyglot System)
Yori auto-detects the language from the output extension (e.g., -o app.py), but you can force specific languages with flags:FlagLanguageTool Used-cppC++g++
-py     Python
-ts     TypeScripttsc-
-rs     Rustrustc
-go     Gogo
-js     JavaScript
-zig    Zigzig
-cs     C#.net

-java   Java
-rb    Ruby 
-php    PHP
-lua    Lua

-jl    Juli 
-hs   Haskell.

Other Flags
-o <name>: Specifies output filename.
-u: Update Mode. Reads existing code and modifies it based on new instructions.
-local / -cloud: Switch AI provider.

Examples1. The Classic (C++) PowerShellyori game.yori -o game.exe
Yori detects .exe, asks for clarification if needed, generates C++, and compiles it.
2. The Web Backend (TypeScript)PowerShell> yori server.yori -ts
Yori generates server.ts and validates typing using tsc.3. The Data Script (Python)PowerShellyori scraper.yori -py
Yori generates scraper.py and checks syntax.4. Interactive Mode (No flag)PowerShellyori app.yori -o my_app
Yori will pause and ask: Plaintext[?] Ambiguous output. Please select target language:
   1. C++ (cpp)      2. Python (py)      3. Rust (rust)
   4. Go (go)        5. Zig (zig)        6. Swift (swift)

 Quick Start TutorialStep 1: Create a Blueprint (hello.yori)YAMLPROGRAM: UniversalHello

// Create a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to N.
// Ask the user for a number.
// Print the sequence.

Step 2: Compile to Rust
PowerShell>.\yori.exe hello.yori -rs
Watch Yori think, generate Rust code, and use rustc to verify it works.Step 3: RunPowerShell.\hello.exe

 FAQ
 1. Do I need to install all 20 languages?
 A: No. If you try to build a Rust app but don't have rustc, Yori will alert you and ask if you want to proceed in "Blind Mode" (generate code without validation).
 2. Can I use this for interpreted languages?
 A: Yes. For languages like Python or JS, Yori uses the interpreter (like node -c) to check for syntax errors before saving the file.
 3. Is the generated code safe?
 A: Treat it like code from StackOverflow. Review it before running it in production.
